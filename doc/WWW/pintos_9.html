This chapter presents a sample assignment and a filled-in design
document for one possible implementation.  Its purpose is to give you an
idea of what we expect to see in your own design documents.

Implement <CODE>thread_join()</CODE>.
</P>
<P>

<A NAME="IDX184"></A>
</P>
<DL>
<DT><U>Function:</U> void <B>thread_join</B> (tid_t <VAR>tid</VAR>)
<DD>Blocks the current thread until thread <VAR>tid</VAR> exits.  If <VAR>A</VAR> is
the running thread and <VAR>B</VAR> is the argument, then we say that
&quot;<VAR>A</VAR> joins <VAR>B</VAR>.&quot;
<P>

Incidentally, the argument is a thread id, instead of a thread pointer,
because a thread pointer is not unique over time.  That is, when a
thread dies, its memory may be, whether immediately or much later,
reused for another thread.  If thread <VAR>A</VAR> over time had two children
<VAR>B</VAR> and <VAR>C</VAR> that were stored at the same address, then
<CODE>thread_join(<VAR>B</VAR>)</CODE> and <CODE>thread_join(<VAR>C</VAR>)</CODE> would be
ambiguous.
</P>
<P>

A thread may only join its immediate children.  Calling
<CODE>thread_join()</CODE> on a thread that is not the caller's child should
cause the caller to return immediately.  Children are not &quot;inherited,&quot;
that is, if <VAR>A</VAR> has child <VAR>B</VAR> and <VAR>B</VAR> has child <VAR>C</VAR>,
then <VAR>A</VAR> always returns immediately should it try to join <VAR>C</VAR>,
even if <VAR>B</VAR> is dead.
</P>
<P>

A thread need not ever be joined.  Your solution should properly free
all of a thread's resources, including its <CODE>struct thread</CODE>,
whether it is ever joined or not, and regardless of whether the child
exits before or after its parent.  That is, a thread should be freed
exactly once in all cases.
</P>
<P>

Joining a given thread is idempotent.  That is, joining a thread
multiple times is equivalent to joining it once, because it has already
exited at the time of the later joins.  Thus, joins on a given thread
after the first should return immediately.
</P>
<P>

You must handle all the ways a join can occur: nested joins (<VAR>A</VAR>
joins <VAR>B</VAR>, then <VAR>B</VAR> joins <VAR>C</VAR>), multiple joins (<VAR>A</VAR>
joins <VAR>B</VAR>, then <VAR>A</VAR> joins <VAR>C</VAR>), and so on.

---- PRELIMINARIES ----

&gt;&gt; If you have any preliminary comments on your submission, notes for
&gt;&gt; the TAs, or extra credit, please give them here.

(This is a sample design document.)

&gt;&gt; Please cite any offline or online sources you consulted while
&gt;&gt; preparing your submission, other than the Pintos documentation,
&gt;&gt; course text, and lecture notes.

None.

                                 JOIN
                                 ====

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

&gt;&gt; Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or `struct'
&gt;&gt; member, global or static variable, `typedef', or enumeration.
&gt;&gt; Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

A &quot;latch&quot; is a new synchronization primitive.  Acquires block
until the first release.  Afterward, all ongoing and future
acquires pass immediately.

    /* Latch. */
    struct latch 
      {
        bool released;              /* Released yet? */
        struct lock monitor_lock;   /* Monitor lock. */
        struct condition rel_cond;  /* Signaled when released. */
      };

Added to struct thread:

    /* Members for implementing thread_join(). */
    struct latch ready_to_die;   /* Release when thread about to die. */
    struct semaphore can_die;    /* Up when thread allowed to die. */
    struct list children;        /* List of child threads. */
    list_elem children_elem;     /* Element of `children' list. */

---- ALGORITHMS ----

&gt;&gt; Briefly describe your implementation of thread_join() and how it
&gt;&gt; interacts with thread termination.

thread_join() finds the joined child on the thread's list of
children and waits for the child to exit by acquiring the child's
ready_to_die latch.  When thread_exit() is called, the thread
releases its ready_to_die latch, allowing the parent to continue.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

&gt;&gt; Consider parent thread P with child thread C.  How do you ensure
&gt;&gt; proper synchronization and avoid race conditions when P calls wait(C)
&gt;&gt; before C exits?  After C exits?  How do you ensure that all resources
&gt;&gt; are freed in each case?  How about when P terminates without waiting,
&gt;&gt; before C exits?  After C exits?  Are there any special cases?

C waits in thread_exit() for P to die before it finishes its own
exit, using the can_die semaphore &quot;down&quot;ed by C and &quot;up&quot;ed by P as
it exits.  Regardless of whether whether C has terminated, there
is no race on wait(C), because C waits for P's permission before
it frees itself.

Regardless of whether P waits for C, P still &quot;up&quot;s C's can_die
semaphore when P dies, so C will always be freed.  (However,
freeing C's resources is delayed until P's death.)

The initial thread is a special case because it has no parent to
wait for it or to &quot;up&quot; its can_die semaphore.  Therefore, its
can_die semaphore is initialized to 1.

---- RATIONALE ----

&gt;&gt; Critique your design, pointing out advantages and disadvantages in
&gt;&gt; your design choices.

This design has the advantage of simplicity.  Encapsulating most
of the synchronization logic into a new &quot;latch&quot; structure
abstracts what little complexity there is into a separate layer,
making the design easier to reason about.  Also, all the new data
members are in `struct thread', with no need for any extra dynamic
allocation, etc., that would require extra management code.

On the other hand, this design is wasteful in that a child thread
cannot free itself before its parent has terminated.  A parent
thread that creates a large number of short-lived child threads
could unnecessarily exhaust kernel memory.  This is probably
acceptable for implementing kernel threads, but it may be a bad
idea for use with user processes because of the larger number of
resources that user processes tend to own.
